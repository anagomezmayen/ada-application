### Essay questions

#### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? 

I have always been interested on task automation and about the useful information one can extract from vast amounts of data, therefore I chose to study Computer Sciences, even when we didn´t even have a PC at home. I think I am one of the few people who is amazed at how advertising showing up on my social media is personalized according to online activity.

Thanks to my last assignment at work I learnt a lot about Excel, (far from my real interests on programming) this was my way to continue programming whilst working on my weekly, quarterly and monthly reports. Currently I like to read as much as I can about technology. Even though I´m not fully informed about current technologies such as Ruby on Rails I´m eager to learn and adapt my skills to the present tools available. 
 
### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 

5 years from now I see myself working for a company or civil organization advocated at promoting the learning of digital technologies among youngsters from less favored segments of the population. I consider my experience in education and technology a perfect match to help others take advantage of technologies in their daily lives and professional future.

### 3. After reading [Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement](http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program), how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community

Being myself a member of a gender group which is underrepresented in the IT sector I would be thrilled to be able to gain enough knowledge and experience in order to help others who are in need of guidance to improve their own digital skills, being this as a trainer in classroom or as a facilitator for prospective internship takers.

### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently? 

When I was at College we had to make a team of 8 (EIGHT) people for a project, which was to develop a company from the beginning. The project would last the whole semester and the final grade would be the average of all grades earned during each of the project stages. This exercise was done in the first year, when none of the team members met each other. As expected, 8 young people with different personalities, tastes, ideas and different ambitions that sought to establish a company were chaos. The first qualification was a resounding D because no one agreed. There were trials, rivalries and at some point some stopped collaborating and others start to work more. I started with another person to establish the company without listening to others, I set my goals and my rules. The work began to take shape and some began to collaborate but I did not take their ideas into account and I did not listen to their opinions because I thought they had no right to comment if they had not helped from the beginning. The result was another D and I felt bad because if I had taken some of their opinions, the rating would have been higher. I had to ask for help and listen to constructive criticism, take opinions and also recognize that there were many better ideas on the part of the team. I learned to listen and work as a team (I think we all did it). In the end we did not get an A+ but I remember that the C made us very happy.

After that I became better listener and working as a team. The university was much better that way and I made very good friends.
